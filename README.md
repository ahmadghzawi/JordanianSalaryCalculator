### Jordanian Salary + Deductions Calculator 
`Calculate Salaries with or without Income Tax and Social Security Deductions`


JSDC web app helps recruiters calculate gross and net salaries. Its key feature is that you can enter the desired annual net salary (salary after deductions) in order to calculate the needed annual and monthly gross salaries (salary before deductions).

For instance, an employee asked for 18,000 JOD net salary after deducting both income tax and social security; the only way you can find the needed gross salary to achieve the desired net salary is by trying out random numbers and performing multiple calculations (trial and error), but using JSDC it's only one click away.
